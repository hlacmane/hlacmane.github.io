            Thursday Tournament
          </div>
          We will host a tournament each Thursday in the SU starting at 6pm and typically running until around 10pm. Costs £3 to enter with half the entry fees being paid back in prize money (the other half pay for use of the tables). It will occasionally be held at Rileys in Coventry and when it is members will be notified in good time; usually a week in advance.

            Sunday Session
          </div>
          Sunday is when we host our more casual pool session. There’s no structured tournament, just an opportunity to play some pool for a few hours. It runs 6-10pm in the SU each Sunday and costs £3, allowing you to stay for as long as you like. Great opportunity to have some fun, improve your game, or just to play some bizarre forms of pool and have a few drinks, it’s what you make of it really!
